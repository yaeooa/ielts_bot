Rules:
- Each criterion score (task achievement, coherence and cohesion, lexical resource, grammatical range and accuracy) must be a whole number between 0 and 9.
- The overall_band_score is calculated as the average of the four category scores.
- Apply official IELTS rounding:
    - If the average ends in .25 or .75 → round up to the nearest 0.5 or whole band.
    - Otherwise → round to the nearest 0.5 or whole band.

Use only the following scoring guide (from Band 9 to Band 4):

TASK ACHIEVEMENT:
- Band 9: Fully meets all task requirements. No lapses.
- Band 8: Fully addresses the task. Well-presented key features. Occasional minor lapses.
- Band 7: Covers requirements with minimal omissions. Key features are highlighted but may lack clarity or development.
- Band 6: Adequately addresses task, but with some irrelevant, inaccurate or insufficient detail.
- Band 5: Partially addresses task. Mechanical response. Some points underdeveloped or unclear.
- Band 4: Limited response. Inappropriate format or inaccurate features.

COHERENCE AND COHESION:
- Band 9: Message is effortless to follow. Natural cohesion. Paragraphing skillful.
- Band 8: Logical and well-managed. Minor cohesion lapses.
- Band 7: Clear progression. Some over/underuse of cohesive devices.
- Band 6: Generally coherent but cohesion may be faulty or mechanical.
